# INSURANCE-FRAUD-CLAIMS-DETECTION-IN-HEALTHCARE
In this project I've created a machine learning model that predicts frauds in health insurance claims.
The raw data was first cleaned, visualized and transformed and then supervised machine learning algorithms were used to train a model and later best model was found on the basis of classifiation report.
